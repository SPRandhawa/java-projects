# ☕ Java Projects

Welcome to my Java repository — a collection of projects and programs that reflect my learning and practice in object-oriented programming, core Java concepts, and problem solving.

Each project in this repository helps me strengthen my programming fundamentals and apply Java to real-world scenarios.
